This academic project presents an implementation of the **K-means clustering algorithm from scratch**.  
Both **Euclidean** and **Mahalanobis** distance metrics are implemented.  

The algorithm is demonstrated on a **sample dataset**, illustrating the classification of **mental health evolution patterns** by applying K-means to the **random effects of subjects**, computed using the **`nlme`** library in R.
